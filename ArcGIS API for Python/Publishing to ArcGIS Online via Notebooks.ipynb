    "# Publishing To ArcGIS Online via Notebooks\n",

    "*Written By: [MATINGO KUMBIRAI N](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumbirai-matingo-6910a617a/)* \n",
    "\n",
    "In this step by step *ArcGIS API for Python* tutorial we are going to publish an item from a CSV file within our machine to our ArcGIS Online Portal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of steps we are going to take to achieve great results in their order: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login to our account [ArcGIS Online Account](https://arcgis.com)\n",
    "2. Use **Pandas** to read & visualize our CSV data\n",
    "3. Upload our CSV file\n",
    "4. Turn CSV file into a **Feature Layer** \n",
    "5. Finally, Add our new Feature Layer to a map\n",
    "\n",
    "All these steps I have outline are going to be carried out within this same notebook. Make sure to understand the *syntax* that is required for every operation that we are going to be performing within this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: You can also use the ArcGIS Pro embedded Notebooks, the API is already pre-installed on installation of the software which automatically makes it easy to perform Notebook operations for Data Science** \n",
    "\n",
    "In case you weren't here during the first tutorial, [here](https://africansurveyors.net/introduction-to-arcgis-api-for-python/) is a resource which you can follow for installation of the ArcGIS API for Python within your local machine. \n",

    "## IMPORTING LIBRARIES\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like what we mentioned in the Introductory guide, every operation within Jupyter Notebooks or that used Python Language as the basis for the operations requires some additional libraries to quicken the processes and automate these workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already downloaded the *Python API*, all we need to do is just call that into the Notebook and keep it ready for use within our space later down the road. \n",
    "\n",
    "So right below, we are going to *import* the following Python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- GIS \n",
    "- Pandas and\n",
    "- getpass \n",
    "\n",
    "I already mentioned what the **GIS** library and the **Pandas** library does for us so I am not going to repeat that. If you have forgotten kindly refer back to the previous tutorials that were published. \n",
    "\n",
    "**getpass** - *The getpass() function prints a prompt then reads input from the user until they press return. The input is passed back as a string to the caller.* [Source](https://pymotw.com/2/getpass/). \n",
    "\n",
    "So basically I need the **getpass()** function to be able to store my password for my ArcGIS Online account and send that as an aunthentication request. The reason why I called this function I don't want anyone reading this to be able to see my password while I record the video tutorial or while I print this document. Its also a great feature for security purposes which keeps all sensitive information secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's import these libraries into our Notebook. "
